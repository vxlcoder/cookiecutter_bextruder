focus of talk:
- share some coding experience
- much of the framework of RF shared through CC

Basic Surfaces & Modeling
FSM
UI
Persistent Data
Maths


1. Python
    - powerful programming language
    - blender api give coders a large set of functions
        - process and manipulate data
        - expose some of blender functionality (opengl)
        - extend blender through add-ons

1. RF tools (Contours, PS) started as "simple" modal operators
    - quickly became quite involved
    - we created frameworks to help us focus
1. simple operator
